# CORS Issue Fix - Restart Required

## The Problem
The API connection is failing because of a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue. The backend is configured for `http://localhost:5173` but your frontend is running on `http://localhost:5174`.

## The Solution
I've added a proxy configuration to Vite that will route all `/api` requests through the development server, avoiding CORS issues.

## What I Changed:
1. **Updated `vite.config.js`** - Added proxy configuration
2. **Updated `src/services/api.js`** - Changed baseURL to use proxy
3. **Enhanced error debugging** - Better error messages in the debug widget

## Action Required:
**You need to restart your development server for the changes to take effect:**

1. **Stop the current server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal
2. **Restart the server**: Run `npm run dev` again
3. **Check the debug widget**: Should now show ✅ Connected

## What the Proxy Does:
- Routes all `/api/*` requests from your frontend to `http://localhost:4000/api`
- Eliminates CORS issues by making requests appear to come from the same origin
- Maintains authentication cookies properly

## After Restart:
- The debug widget should show "✅ Connected"
- All API calls should work properly
- No more CORS errors in the browser console

## Alternative Solution (if proxy doesn't work):
If you prefer not to use the proxy, you can ask your backend developer to update the CORS configuration to allow `http://localhost:5174` in addition to `http://localhost:5173`.
