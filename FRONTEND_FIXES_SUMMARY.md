# Frontend API Integration Fixes - Summary

## âœ… **All Issues Fixed Successfully**

### **1. User Logout on Page Refresh** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: Users were being logged out on page refresh
- **Root Cause**: CORS issues preventing proper authentication persistence
- **Solution**: 
  - Added Vite proxy configuration to route `/api` requests through development server
  - Updated `src/services/api.js` to use proxy instead of direct backend URL
  - Authentication now persists correctly across page refreshes

### **2. Profile Section Data Issues** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: Profile only showed basic user information instead of full API data
- **Root Cause**: Profile component wasn't fetching fresh user data from API
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced profile data initialization to include all available user fields
  - Added automatic user data refresh when profile tab is active
  - Improved profile display to show phone number and verification status
  - Updated to handle various user data field names from backend

### **3. Payment Flow Not Working** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: Payment process was broken and didn't update UI properly
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect data structure and missing order creation logic
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed payment success handling to properly create order records
  - Added support for both cart purchases and direct purchases
  - Implemented proper cart clearing after successful payment
  - Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### **4. "Buy It Now" Button Behavior** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: "Buy It Now" was adding items to cart instead of direct purchase
- **Root Cause**: Button was calling `handleAddToCart()` instead of direct purchase logic
- **Solution**:
  - Completely rewrote `handleBuyNow()` function for direct purchase
  - Creates order data immediately and navigates to payment page
  - No longer interferes with cart functionality
  - Added `isDirectPurchase` flag to distinguish purchase types

### **5. Cart Adds Unwanted Items** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: Cart was adding irrelevant data and unwanted items
- **Root Cause**: Cart was storing excessive product data and incorrect data structures
- **Solution**:
  - Cleaned up cart data structure to store only essential information
  - Removed unnecessary product data that was causing bloat
  - Fixed cart totals calculation to handle different data structures
  - Ensured cart only contains relevant purchase items

### **6. Unwanted Data Being Added** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: Frontend was sending irrelevant data to backend APIs
- **Root Cause**: API calls included unnecessary fields and wishlist data
- **Solution**:
  - Streamlined cart data to include only essential fields (id, name, price, images)
  - Removed wishlist functionality from cart operations
  - Cleaned up order data structure to match backend expectations
  - Ensured only relevant purchase data is sent to APIs

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Improvements Made**
